      <h2>STR and hospitality operations</h2>
      <p class="sub">We run your doors like a control room: guest tone, timing, SLAs, and escalations are mapped up front. You get receipts for every handoff and weekly KPIs so you always know occupancy, ADR, and exceptions.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Daily guest messaging uses your voice and rules. SLA tags keep responses tight, and review replies stay on brand. Nothing is ad hoc: templates are tested, and every message leaves a trail so you can audit performance.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Vendors and cleaners receive clear briefs, codes, and schedules. We log photos, receipts, and issues. When something breaks, you get options, not noise: repair, defer, or escalate with costs and timing attached.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Weekly we surface occupancy, ADR, reviews, and outliers. You see actions already taken and the few you need to decide. Inventory and restock notes sit in one place, ready for your next turnover cycle.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Your PMS, Airbnb, and comms channels stay in sync. If a guest asks twice, it is an exception we track, not a pattern we ignore. The goal: consistent, calm operations that protect ratings and revenue.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Real estate admin and transaction support</h2>
      <p class="sub">Listings, offers, disclosures, and client updates are handled like a checklist-driven launch. We keep your CRM clean and your clients informed without you chasing details.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Every listing starts with a playbook: assets, dates, showings, and status broadcasts. Offer packets and disclosures are assembled with zero guesswork. Clients get clear updates, not jargon.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Your CRM is a source of truth. Tasks, dates, milestones, and notes stay current. We run weekly hygiene so nothing sits in limbo. Prep notes for inspections and signings keep you and your clients prepared.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Vendors, lenders, and attorneys receive structured communication. We timestamp every interaction so you can audit any file. If a deadline is at risk, you hear it early with a plan to keep it on track.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">You get daily receipts and a weekly snapshot: wins, risks, and next moves. No buried emails, no missing paperwork, no mystery follow-ups.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="grid two" style="align-items:start;">
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Inbox, calendar, and executive rhythm</h2>
      <p class="sub">We turn your inbox into a command center. VIP routing, SLA tags, templated replies, and calendars with buffers and prep notes keep you ahead without overbooking.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">We codify your voice and rules: who is VIP, what is urgent, and what can wait. Templates carry your tone. Quiet hours and auto-filing reduce noise without losing signal.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Daily you get a decide-route-delegate digest. Calendar holds include prep notes, attachments, and buffers so meetings start ready. If a slot moves, we coordinate and confirm with all parties.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Escalations are immediate for critical items. Everything else flows through clear SLAs. You will never wonder if something was answered or scheduled—it is documented and timestamped.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">The result: fewer interruptions, predictable responses, and a calendar that supports focus instead of breaking it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Lead intake and client communication</h2>
      <p class="sub">Frontline intake, qualification, scheduling, and follow-ups happen with receipts. Your pipeline moves because every touch is logged, owned, and closed out.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">We pick up every inquiry with scripts you approve. Qualification is documented. Handoffs to sales are scheduled with clear next steps and reminders.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Follow-up sequences match your tone—warm, persistent, and timestamped. Proposals go out on time, and reminders are automatic. Nothing quietly ages out.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Your CRM reflects reality, not guesses. Stalled leads are flagged early with options. You can open any record and see who owns it, what happened, and what is next.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Daily receipts show what moved; weekly rollups show pipeline health. You stay in control without chasing status updates.</p>

  <div class="grid two" style="align-items:start;">
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Social and video support</h2>
      <p class="sub">We treat creative like a campaign: organized assets, checkpoints, and clear approvals. Captions, schedules, trims, and clips ship on time and on spec.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Content lives in sprints. We draft captions, queue posts, and run comment sweeps. Approval checkpoints keep you in control without creating bottlenecks.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Video trims and clips come captioned and platform-ready. Deliverables are organized by campaign and versioned. Revisions are limited and scheduled to avoid churn.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Performance notes are concise: what landed, what to repeat, and what to pause. We do not drown you in dashboards—we surface the signal.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Your brand voice stays intact. Every post and reply is traceable. Engagement is proactive, not reactive.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Documentation, data hygiene, and QA</h2>
      <p class="sub">We turn tribal knowledge into documented steps and keep your data clean with scheduled QA. Deviations are reported with fixes, not just findings.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">SOPs include screenshots, acceptance criteria, and owners. Versioning is tracked so updates are controlled, not chaotic.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Data hygiene is on a schedule. Spot checks catch drift early. When we find an issue, we fix it and log the before/after so you see progress.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Exception reports are concise: what went off-spec, why, and how we corrected it. The goal is repeatable workflows that survive turnover.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Your systems stay trustworthy. Reports reflect reality because the inputs are right and the process is enforced.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Custom workflows and automations</h2>
      <p class="sub">Boards, CRMs, and automations are scoped, built, and maintained with an owner. We recommend architecture, prototype, QA, and train your team so adoption sticks.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">We start with requirements and constraints. Then we propose a build that fits how you work, not the other way around. No surprise tools; just intentional architecture.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Prototypes ship quickly. QA is not optional. Documentation and quick-reference guides keep teams aligned and reduce rework.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">After launch, we monitor performance and adoption. An owner stays assigned for updates, tweaks, and new integrations.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">When risks appear, you hear them early with options. The outcome: workflows that stay reliable as you grow.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Personal and executive support</h2>
      <p class="sub">Travel, personal logistics, research, and reminders are handled quietly. You see confirmations and receipts, not to-do lists.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Trips, holds, and changes come with complete itineraries and backups. Reservations and deliveries are confirmed and logged.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Recurring needs are documented once so they repeat flawlessly. Reminders are proactive. You do not have to restate preferences.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">Research, sourcing, and vendor coordination come with options and costs. We do the legwork; you decide with clarity.</p>
      <p class="svc-body">You stay focused on high-leverage work while the details run in the background with receipts for everything.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="card" style="margin-top:22px;">
    <h2>How we keep you informed</h2>
    <p class="sub">Clarity beats noise. Every service follows the same reporting rhythm so you always know what shipped, what is next, and what needs your decision.</p>
